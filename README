Not a real README, just need to leave some notes about building this
thing as it is at the moment.


- building:
  - run autoconf to generate a configure script.
  - ./configure --prefix=/local/ocrspell-<version>
  - edit Makefile, delete spell.c from SRCS and spell.o from OBJS.
  - make depend
  - make
  - install files by hand

- don't know what spell.[ch] is needed for.  the link fails unless you
  delete it from SRCS and OBJS in the Makefile.  same routines are in
  statcheck.c.

- was missing letter_ngram.freq, ocr_untrained.freq, and ocr.freq.
  snarfed them from /raid1/ccd0/execs/SPARC_5.7/local/ocrspell/share.

- there's no install target.  ocrspell goes in bin, ocrspell.el in
  lib, quick_demo.txt in doc, and those 3 files mentioned above in
  share.
